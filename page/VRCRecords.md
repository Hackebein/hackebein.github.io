This project is an automated service designed to capture instances or events in VRChat in 4K resolution at 30 FPS, with dynamic camera movements. It supports live viewing and streaming via Spout, NDI, and RTSPâ€”features that make it ideal for VJ sets or any live broadcasting scenario. Future plans included self-hosting options and expanded capabilities for video and film production.

Over the course of two years, this system generated hundreds of hours of automated recordings. However, the project is now largely on hold due to continuous changes in VRChat's hardware requirements are getting more affordable.
