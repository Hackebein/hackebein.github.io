My VR journey began at Gamescom 2014, where Elite Dangerous showcased the first Oculus headset. Buying experimental hardware wasn't feasible then, but the Vive Pro announcement in 2017 led me to try VRChat at a friend's place. I purchased my own headset in 2018, when VRChat's main rival was Beat Saber. Today, I've accumulated over 30,000 hours in VR.

Despite its limitations, VRChat's huge user base is remarkable. Socializing and creating there is both engaging and fun. Over the years, I've worked on several projects—alone or with others—including:

- Object Tracking
- Citizen of VRChat (unreleased game)
- VRCRecords
- Music Train Truck (unreleased project)
- Translating the VRChat client
- Maintaining the VRChat Wiki
- VR Pole Dance (VRPD)
- Live performance events (Sanctum, Peppercast XR, ...)
