In 2019 The Community around Grand Theft Auto 5 and Roleplayers started ramping up in players. The Roleplay Community were using modified clients like RageMP and alt:V with different voice server solutions. In 2021 more players were playing GTA5 Roleplay then the base game. In 2023 Rockstar acquires cfx.re, which includes FiveM, One of the most commenly used modded clients today.

I'm supporting Communities around GTA RP to host there servers. One of them got setup and build to run forever using auto system updates, a thin stack of software including docker. The Docker Image is kept up-to-date by FiveM Team. The Team who programming the server have 3 stages, files are handles manually over SCP by choice. I'm frequently checking on the server if everything is still working for the last 4 years. It just works, kept alive and up-to-date by 3 simple cron jobs (backups, system updates, docker updates). While used by a changing Team.
